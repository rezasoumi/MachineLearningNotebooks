# Machine Learning Course Projects

## Overview

This repository contains the source codes and implementations of various machine learning algorithms completed during the Machine Learning course at Sharif University of Technology (Prof: Seyed Abolfazl Motahari). Each section represents a different topic or technique covered in the course, and the projects demonstrate practical applications of the algorithms.
